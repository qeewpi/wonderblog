> There’s no reason to fear failure as long as you remain confident that you will improve from that failure.

Remember the feeling of indecision because of your fear of failure? When you fail to act, you avoid the opportunity to learn.

You no longer have to be afraid of whether your decision is a good one or a bad one when you realize you can always learn from whatever the result turns out to be.
