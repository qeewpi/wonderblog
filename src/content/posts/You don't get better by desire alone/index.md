Wanting something isn't enough.

Wanting to be better isn't enough.

Wanting to win isn't enough.

But thinking about the steps to get to your destination is enough.

Instead of hyper-focusing on results, you need to focus on the process.

When you stay in the present and think about what actions you need to make, the results will come after.

Stay in the present and you might just surprise yourself.
