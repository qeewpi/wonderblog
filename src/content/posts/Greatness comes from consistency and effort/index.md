I came across a video analysis of a professional VALORANT player's gameplay. At the end of the video, I unexpectedly gathered insights I can apply not only within the game, but also out of it.

I've observed many elements of video games, such as strategical thinking or maintaining mental fortitude, are equally applicable in our own lives.

I believe the video reinforces one of the most crucial points out of all these interconnected ideas: 

> In order to be great at something, you have to put in the time and effort.

Have you ever noticed that the people in the 0.1% percentile of any field (or skill such as playing the guitar or programming), are more often than not the ones with the most time and effort put into it?

Overnight success is a myth – it's thousands of hours of consistency and effort that primes you for the right opportunity.

Those who believe that greatness comes from "natural talent" are those who prefer to live in the comfort of the belief that greatness can be achieved with ease. 

Nothing worth it ever comes easy – remember that.
