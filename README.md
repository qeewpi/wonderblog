## Blog

### Background

I've always wanted to have a *public* outlet for my write-ups, think pieces, or documentation, in hopes that the content I'd publish may come across as useful to some. It wasn't until I'd been able to set up a more concrete system for my note-taking that the idea started taking shape.

The core of my idea for my blog was to reduce the friction between writing and publishing as much as possible. Since my note-taking system lives within Obsidian, I looked into similar implementations and came across Hugo. I went ahead and experimented with integrating Hugo and Obsidian, and with a couple of references and trial and error, I've been able to lay out the foundations of my blog.

Keep in mind that the blog currently is *bare-bones*, and I've yet to actually add customizations to Hugo. However, I believe the scripts in the repository are capable enough for my needs and there is only little tweaking needed to make the entire publication process (Obsidian &rarr; Hugo) more seamless.
